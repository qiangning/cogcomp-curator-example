Lol at people that still think Anonymous is a group. Rather than literally fucking anybody. From an activist to an organised intellegence agency. Anybody can fall under the Anon banner if they please.

Anonymous before top response - "Yeah, take that one, ISIS!"

Top response - "this could be a bad move because government uses these accounts to track ISIS"

Anonymous after top response - "Oh.... Well uhhh.... We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us."

Anonymous wants internet freedoms so that they, a notorious organisation which is often associated with terrorism, can continue to enjoy freedoms, and what do they do?

Publish the details of members that support a notorious organisation which is often associated with terrorism.

It wasn't so long ago that Anonymous had members being targeted by intelligence agencies and were spitting fire about members being exposed on the grounds that they were a notorious organisation which is often associated with terrorism.

I guess when the shoe is on the other foot, it is more comfortable for them.

Anonymous thinks small. They think the government isn't equipped to shut down some user accounts? They keep them up because then they know exactly what they are saying, what moves they are making, and who they are contacting. Why would they pay for information that it's almost guaranteed they have? The military invented tor, the NSA is more advanced than you can imagine. Seeing and tracking your targets is the smart way to do things, if they disappear from online, the govt. is fucked. Just like when the Taliban broke off and started communicating on paper again.

I've got a good idea for a game using this data set. A space invaders like game but each block you have to destroy would be a little tweety bird linked to a different one of these twitter names and every time they get destroyed a bot would tweet the "you've been killed or something to the twitter handle. could be a fun way of spamming them while keeping other people amused.

Here's the thing. If they're just sympathizers and not actual members of ISIS then I think they have the right to freely express their support under free speech. It's terrible and absolutely disgusting to support those monsters, but at the same time it's speech.

Now, paying money or participating in their operations is something else.

Twitter hasn't done anything because the US Gov doesn't want them to, regardless of Twitter's preferences. For the same reason governments manipulate foreign politics to place known individuals in charge: it's better to have a known and understood evil in place than an unknown or misunderstood one.

All of this blocking of ISIS/ISIL data is hurting, not helping, the intelligence agencies fighting against them. It reduces the electronic trails to the sources to get to the root of the problem It's like how OBL stopped using cellphones, it made it much tougher to find him. I agree that it's repellent that they're using social media to recruit but consider how turning off the information spigot will impact the intelligence community.

"Inside sources" implies that these Twitter accounts were actually working for the feds. As a social scientist I can tell you that research on social media is embarrasingly far behind the developments in the field, and I find it very hard to believe that FBI or CIA have come up with some CSI tech to track, trace and triangulate anyone based on Twitter handles.

I think these hackers are doing what most of the planet would like to do. Smack ISIS in the face and say 'fuck you'.

Anonymous no longer exists. Everyone associated with lulzsec was busted. There is simply no way that the government isn't using 'Anonymous' for their own agenda.

The final boss of the internet is the NSA. There is no anonymity.

Twitter is most likely under pressure by several government agencies not to suspend them. The more these people talk the more information they devulge. It is a statistical situation that has to balance out the threat of isis recruiting against the prospect of gaining actionable intelligence with no effort expended.

I tried to make this comment sound as thought out and well spoken as possible as I am currently taking a shit.

Let me start this by saying I find ISIL abhorrent. But should Twitter be making determinations on who may use it as a medium. In this decade, both the internet and derivatively social media, have become public goods. I.E. The reason netizens are so pro-net neutrality is the because of the philosophy that the connections created between individuals online should only be regulated in the same way we would regulate interactions between individuals in a public square. The question I ask is, given such a framework ought public forums (such as twitter as well as reddit) be in the business of determining who may use their channel for what speech?
